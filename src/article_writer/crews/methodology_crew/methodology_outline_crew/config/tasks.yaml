    **Analytical Report** 

    {report}  

    Analyze the provided analytical report to extract key methodological components necessary for generating a structured summary for the "Methodology"
    section of a scientific paper. Focus on identifying the core research design, experimental setups, materials, primary procedures, data collection and
    initial data analysis methods directly described or clearly implied within the report. The goal is to provide a comprehensive summary of
    the fundamental "how-to" aspects of the study based on the report.

    **Input Detailing**:  
    - **Analytical Report**
      - Has the following five sections:  
        1. Apresentação Clara dos Elementos Visuais (Presentation of Visual Elements)  
        2. Análise dos Resultados (Analysis of Results)  
        3. Interpretação Crítica (Critical Interpretation)  
        4. Avaliação das Limitações do Estudo (Evaluation of Study Limitations)  
        5. Contribuições (Contributions)  

    **Execution Steps**:  
    1. Review the **Analytical Report**, specifically scrutinizing sections 1, 2, and parts of 3 for explicit descriptions of experimental procedures,
       data collection methods, materials used, initial analytical steps, and specific techniques.
    2. Identify and categorize distinct methodological components. For each, extract:
        - **Method Name/Description**: A concise name or description (e.g., "Síntese Química", "Microscopia Eletrônica de Varredura", "Pré-processamento de Imagens").
        - **Purpose/Primary Aim**: What was the direct objective of using this method in the study (e.g., 'to quantify protein concentration', 
          'to synthesize nanoparticles'), as inferred from the report. Avoid extensive justifications for its choice over alternatives here.
        - **Key Parameters/Details**: Specifics like equipment models, software versions, sample sizes, durations, etc., if clearly stated.
    3. Synthesize the extracted information into a structured Markdown summary. Each methodological component should be a distinct heading, with its 
      details presented as sub-points.

    **Guidelines**:  
    - **Specificity**: Extract precise details about methodologies directly from the report.
    - **Completeness**: Aim to cover all primary methods described or strongly implied for replication.
    - **Objectivity**: Report methods as described, without adding external context or interpretations.
    - **Traceability**: All extracted information must be directly verifiable within the provided analytical report.

    **Restrictions**:  
    - Do not invent methods or details not mentioned in the analytical report.  
    - Do not include interpretations of results, discussions of findings, or explicit links to conclusions; focus only on the methods themselves as 
      presented in the report.  
    - Do not generate prose or narrative beyond describing the methods; output must be structured Markdown.  
    - Do not assume methods based on typical scientific practices if not mentioned in the report.

    **Success Criteria**:  
    - Returns a Markdown formatted text containing a comprehensive and structured summary of identified methodological components from the analytical report.  
    - Each component includes its name/description, purpose, and key parameters/details, clearly delineated in Markdown.
  expected_output: >

analyze_sections_for_methodological_context:
  description: >
    **Generated Section Contents:**

    {generated_sections_content}

    Analyze the provided content from previously generated sections (Results and Discussion, Conclusion) to extract and summarize
    methodological context. The goal is to identify how specific methods or experimental approaches are discussed in relation to
    the study's findings, interpretations, and conclusions, providing contextual links that enrich the methodology section.
    Focus on methodological implications, validation mentions, limitations tied to methods, or specific procedural explanations
    that were elaborated upon in these sections.

    **Input Detailing**:
    - **Generated Section Contents**: A JSON list where each element is an object that contains the full content of "Results and Discussion"
      and "Conclusion" sections, respectivaly. The objects are structured as follows:
      - `section_name` (string): The name of the section.
      - `topics` (list of objects): A list of topic objects, each representing a specific topic within the section and its corresponding 
        textual content. Each topic object includes:
        - `topic` (string): The name of the specific topic.
        - `text_content` (string): The generated text content for that topic.
        - `subsection` (string): Name of the subsection of which the topic belongs. If 'main', means that the topic belongs directly to 
          the main section (i.e., not part of a named subsection).

    **Execution Steps**:
      1. Carefully iterate through each object containing a section, analysing each of it's topics text content, making sure to:
         - Identify any mentions of methodological aspects, their implications, validations, limitations, or procedural elaborations.
         - Pay attention to how methods are *contextualized* in relation to the specific results or conclusions of that topic.
         - Extract key phrases or summarized points that link methods to outcomes.
      2. Synthesize the identified contextual methodological information into a structured Markdown summary. Organize by section and then by topic,
         highlighting the methodological nuances derived from the interpretation or final statements.

    **Guidelines**:
      - **Contextual Focus**: Emphasize how methods are discussed in relation to *what was found* or *concluded*, rather than just listing methods.
      - **Traceability**: All extracted information must be directly attributable to the `text_content` of the input sections.
      - **No Redundancy**: Avoid simply repeating methodological details already expected from the analytical report; focus on contextual insights.
      - **Clarity**: Ensure the summary clearly outlines the methodological *context* provided by the generated text.

    **Restrictions**:
      - Do not invent methodological context or details. All of your findings must be traceable back to the generated sections in the input.
      - Do not summarize the findings or conclusions themselves; focus on the methodological links.
      - Do not generate prose or narrative beyond structuring the summary; output must be structured Markdown.

    **Success Criteria**:
      - Returns a Markdown formatted text containing a comprehensive and structured summary of methodological context derived from the generated section 
        contents.
      - The summary is organized by section and topic, providing specific insights into how methods are discussed in relation to outcomes.
  expected_output: >
    A structured text summary, formatted in Markdown, without ```, containing the methodological context from previously generated sections, following 
    the structure:

define_methodology_subsections:
  description: >
    Analyze the extracted core methodological components and their contextual discussions, provided from the tasks 
    `analyze_report_for_methodology_components` and `analyze_sections_for_methodological_context` outputs, to define a logical structure of 
    subsections for the "Methodology" section of a scientific paper. The primary goal is to categorize the methodological information into 
    coherent, distinct subsections. The first subsection MUST be named "Introduction", serving as an overview for the Methodology section, 
    summarizing the general research approach and the rationale behind the chosen methods. Subsequent subsections should logically group 
    related experimental procedures, materials, data collection, and analysis methods.

    **Execution Steps**:
    1. Review the detailed methodological components and contextual insights provided from previous analysis tasks.
    2. Identify overarching categories or stages within the research methodology.
    3. Define subsection names that are clear, concise, and accurately represent these categories.
    4. Ensure the first subsection is always "Introduction". For this "Introduction" subsection, synthesize a `subsection_description` that 
       briefly introduces the study's overall methodological approach and the basis for the general strategy for using specific methods, drawing 
       from the general methodological scope identified in the input.
    5. For all subsequent subsections, create a `subsection_name` and a `subsection_description` that briefly outlines what will be covered 
       within that subsection, based on the methodological components identified.
    6. Ensure the order of subsections follows a logical flow, typically from general design to specific procedures and analysis.
    7. Assemble your response into a JSON object, with two keys:
      - `section_name` (string): Set to "Methodology".
      - `subsections` (list): A list of objects, where each object represents a defined subsection, with the keys:
        - `subsection_name` (string): A concise title for the subsection.
        - `subsection_description` (string): A brief summary outlining the key elements that will be covered within this subsection.
        - `discussion_topics` (list):  An empty list `[]`, as topics of discussion are not generated in this task.

    **Guidelines**:
    - **Completeness**: All major methodological aspects derived from the inputs should be logically accommodated within the defined subsections.
    - **Clarity**: Subsection names should be intuitive and indicative of their content.
    - **Logical Flow**: The sequence of subsections should guide the reader through the methodology step-by-step.
    - **Traceability**: All defined subsections must be justified by the content of the input methodological components and context.
    - **"Introduction" Subsection**: This subsection is mandatory and should provide a high-level overview of the methodological strategy.

    **Restrictions**:
    - Do not create specific discussion topics within this task; focus only on defining the subsections and their brief descriptions.
    - Do not invent methodological details not present in the input.
    - Do not generate prose or narrative beyond the subsection names and descriptions; output must be structured JSON.
    - Do not generate more than 5-7 subsections, aiming for a concise and logical structure.

    **Success Criteria**:
    - The output is a valid JSON object.
    - The JSON object contains a key `section_name` with the value "Methodology".
    - The JSON object contains a key `subsections` which is a **list** of subsection objects.
    - The first object in the `subsections` list has `subsection_name` set to "Introduction".
    - Each object in the `subsections` list has `subsection_name` (string) and `subsection_description` (string).
    - The `discussion_topics` list for each subsection is present but **empty**.
    - All major methodological categories implied by the input data are represented by distinct subsections.
    - The logical flow of subsections is maintained (e.g., from general design to specific methods).
    - The number of subsections is between 3 and 7, ensuring appropriate granularity without being overly detailed or too broad.

  expected_output: >
    A JSON object representing the outline for the "Introduction" section, structured as follows:

    - **`section_name`** (string): Must be "Introduction".
    - **`subsections`** (list of objects): A list containing definitions for each subsection. Each object in this list must contain:
      - **`subsection_name`** (string): A concise title for the subsection (e.g., "Background and Topic Relevance", "Research Problem and Justification").
      - **`subsection_description`** (string): A brief summary outlining the key elements that will be covered within this subsection.
      - **`discussion_topics`** (list): An empty list `[]`, as topics are not generated in this step.

    **The output must satisfy the following criteria**:
      - The JSON object is valid and strictly adheres to the described structure.
      - The `section_name` is exactly "Introduction".
      - The `subsections` list is not empty and contains between 3 and 7 subsection objects.
      - Every subsection object includes both `subsection_name` and `subsection_description` as non-empty strings.
      - The `discussion_topics` list for every subsection object is an empty list `[]`.
      - All major thematic components necessary for a comprehensive introduction (identified from the input analyses, such as background,
        problem statement, objectives, and paper structure) are logically represented by distinct subsections.
      - The order of subsections follows a clear and logical narrative flow, typically progressing from establishing general context and relevance, 
        to defining the specific problem and justification, to stating the study's objectives, and concluding with the paper's structure.

expand_introduction_subsections:
  description: >
    For each subsection defined by the `define_introduction_subsections` task, detail the discussion topics to be expanded into textual content.
    The goal is to break down each `subsection_description` into actionable writing points (topics) that capture the narrative aspects of the Introduction.
    Use the contextual summary from `extract_context_for_introduction` and the subsection definitions from `define_introduction_subsections` as a basis.
    For each topic, create a concise title, assign a rhetorical purpose, write a detailed description integrating the extracted context, and provide
    clear narrative guidance for a Writer Agent.

    **Input Detailing**:
      - Output of `define_introduction_subsections`: JSON object with the Introduction's subsection structure.
      - Output of `extract_context_for_introduction`: Markdown summary of relevant context.

    **Execution Steps**:
    1. Parse the output of `define_introduction_subsections` to get subsections and their descriptions.
    2. For each subsection:
        - Review its `subsection_description` and the contextual summary from `extract_context_for_introduction`.
        - Identify key points or arguments that should be developed within that subsection to fulfill its narrative purpose.
        - For each point/argument, formulate a concise `topic_title`.
        - Assign the most appropriate `rhetorical_purpose` from the list below.
        - Develop a comprehensive `topic_description`, integrating relevant information from the contextual summary (e.g., theoretical concepts for "Background," specific problems for "Research Problem").
        - Craft detailed `narrative_guidance`, instructing the Writer Agent on how to articulate the topic, what tone to use, and which elements of the context to emphasize to build a cohesive and persuasive argument.
    3. Assemble each defined topic into its own JSON object.
    4. Update the `discussion_topics` list for each subsection object in the parsed `define_introduction_subsections` output with the generated topic objects.
    5. Ensure the final output is a single JSON object.

    **List of allowed rhetorical purposes for the Introduction**:
       - "Establish general context":
          Clarification: "Present the broader field of study, its relevance, and the state of the art, setting the stage for the specific problem."
