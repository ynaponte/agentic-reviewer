    **Generated Section Contents:**

    {generated_sections_content}

    Analyze the provided content from previously generated sections (Results and Discussion) to extract and summarize
    key interpretive content, implications, limitations, and contributions that are essential for shaping the
    "Conclusion" section. The goal is to identify how specific findings were interpreted, discussed, or how their
    implications were elaborated in relation to the study's overall message. This task ensures the conclusion
    is consistent with the preceding detailed sections.

    **Input Detailing**:
    - **Generated Section Contents**: A JSON object that organizes and contains the full content of the section "Results and Discussion". 
      The object is structured as follows:
      - `section_name` (string): The name of the section ("Resultados e Discussão", in portuguese).
      - `topics` (list of objects): A list of topic objects, each representing a specific topic within the section and its corresponding 
        textual content. Each topic object includes:
        - `topic` (string): The name of the specific topic.
        - `text_content` (string): The generated text content for that topic.
        - `subsection` (string): Name of the subsection of which the topic belongs. If 'main', means that the topic belongs directly to 
          the main section (i.e., not part of a named subsection).

    **Execution Steps**:
      1. Access the `section_name` ("Resultados e Discussão") and its `topics` list in the `generated_sections_content` JSON object.
      2. For each topic object in the `topics` list:
        - Use the `topic` name (e.g., "Interpretação dos Dados de Eficiência") as the primary identifier for analysis and summary.
        - Analyze the `text_content` to identify:
          - Elaborated interpretations of findings, focusing on how results are discussed in relation to the study's objectives.
          - Discussions of implications or significance of results, noting their contribution to the study's overall message.
          - Limitations discussed in the context of specific findings.
          - Contributions or novel aspects highlighted within the discussion of results.
          - Gaps, unresolved issues, or implications that suggest potential future research directions (e.g., limitations in scalability, 
          unaddressed applications, or emerging trends).
       - Note the `subsection` (e.g., 'main' or a named subsection like "Environmental Impact Analysis") to contextualize the topic's placement.
      3. Infer 1-2 potential future research directions for each relevant topic based on identified gaps, limitations, or implications in the 
         `text_content`, ensuring these are logical extensions of the content.
      4. Synthesize the identified information into a structured Markdown summary, organized by subsection (use 'main' as the name of the 
         subsection for topics directly under the section) and then by topic, highlighting the most relevant interpretive, implicative, 
         limiting, and contributive insights for the "Conclusion" section.
      5. Ensure the summary emphasizes the interpretive context (how findings lead to discussion) and avoids merely restating factual results.

    **Guidelines**:
    - **Contextual Focus**: Prioritize the interpretation of findings, their implications, limitations, and contributions as presented in the 
      `text_content` of the "Results and Discussion" section.
    - **Traceability**: Ensure all summarized content is directly attributable to the `text_content` of the topics in the input JSON.
    - **Clarity and Organization**: Structure the summary clearly by subsection and topic, ensuring it provides actionable insights for the 
      "Conclusion" section.
    - **Subsection Awareness**: Use the `subsection` field to group topics appropriately, distinguishing between main section topics and 
      subsection-specific topics.

    **Restrictions**:
    - Only use content from the `text_content` of the "Resultados e Discussão" section's `topics` list in the provided JSON input.
    - Do not invent interpretations, implications, limitations, or contributions not present in the `text_content`.
    - Do not summarize or include content related to methods or other sections outside "Resultados e Discussão".
    - Avoid generating narrative prose beyond the structured Markdown summary required for the output.

    **Success Criteria**:
    - Produces a Markdown-formatted summary that comprehensively captures interpretive content, implications, limitations, and contributions 
      from the "Resultados e Discussão" section.
    - Organizes the summary by subsection (or 'main') and topic, ensuring clear attribution to the `text_content` of each topic.
    - Provides specific, relevant insights that align with the study's overall message and are suitable for shaping the "Conclusion" section.
    - Avoids redundancy with the `analyze_report_for_conclusion` task by focusing on interpretive and contextual insights rather than factual results.
