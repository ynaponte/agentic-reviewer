The study demonstrates that genetic algorithms (AGs) are effective in optimizing core distances for achieving desired contrast levels in logical arrangements, specifically focusing on OR gates. In triangular arrangements with three cores, the best achieved contrast ratio was 1.02 dB, which is close to the target value of 0.3 dB. For quadrilateral arrangements involving four cores, while specific values are not provided, it is noted that the optimization process becomes more complex due to increased interactions between cores. This comprehensive approach provides a robust framework for optimizing core distances in various logical arrangements using genetic algorithms, with promising results even when scaling up from three to four cores.

The key findings include:
1. **Triangular Arrangement**: The contrast ratio achieved was 1.02 dB.
2. **Quadrilateral Arrangement**: While the exact values are not specified, the complexity increases as more cores interact.

This study highlights the potential of genetic algorithms in optimizing core distances for achieving desired performance metrics in logical arrangements.
